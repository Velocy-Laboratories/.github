## Velocy Laboratories

We are a software development group that currently has big plans for the future. Our goal is it not only to solve one problem in our society. We want to solve problems without creating new problems that the generations after us have to solve.

### But how?
Software is a big market in our world and much can be done wrong. Starting off in the videogame industry, we want to look what problems in the branches are present, and which one we can solve with our software solutions.

### I have a cool idea!
That's cool! If you match our current branche and want us to know about your idea and how we could solve a specific problem with it, don't hesitate to write your idea into an email. (hey@velocy.cloud)
